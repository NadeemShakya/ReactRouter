<h1> Using WebPack to access our Project. </h1>

In our project directory i.e. Inside of ReactRouter-V4 in Command Prompt( For example: C:Users\ABC\ReactRouter-V4 >), hit the following commands:

<ul>
  <li><b>npx webpack </b> - to configure webpack and bundle our files. </li>
  <li><b> npm run dev </b> - to run our project using webpack-dev-server. </li>
  <li> Check the server url for the webpack-dev-server. Mine is http://localhost:8080/</li>
  <li> Hit the url in the browser. </li>
</ul>

Your index.html file should now open with a message of - "Welcome to React Router Tutorial".

<p> Hurrah! The project is now being accessed using WebPack.</p>
